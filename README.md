# Sigma Bot
This is a simple Twitter bot using Tweepy that posts a status update every hour with a new word it has declared as being sigma.
It iterates through a list of words created from the text file: `shuffled_words.txt`
It logs authentication, status updates, and errors.

## shuffle.py
This is a simple python script that will shuffle the words in `words_alpha.txt` and writes the shuffled word list into `words_shuffled.txt`
You can manually add and remove words if you wish.

## Usage
With a Twitter developer account, and a Twitter application the bot can be run using the authentication credentials that Twitter provides.
```./main.py```
